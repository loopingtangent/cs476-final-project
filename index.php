        In today’s busy world, people are finding themselves overwhelmed with the number of tasks on their to do lists.
        While productivity and efficiency are becoming more and more important, too much time is spent trying to decide
        where to start.  The process of organizing and prioritizing each task is taking up precious time that could be
        used more productively.

        Pick 4 Me takes away the pressure of  deciding where to start and eliminates the time it takes to plan and
        prioritizes each task on your to-do list.  Pick 4 Me will also help you save time making everyday decisions
        like what to make for supper or what type of exercise to do.  The program’s objective is to allow users to
        store a series of lists with the ability to run them. Running a list will result in the system making a decision
        for the user.  The list items are assigned a priority, with higher priority items being more likely to be selected.
        Lists will also include one lucky item with a 1-5% chance of being selected, this allows for rewards like
        guilt-free spare time or ordering take out.

        The modern style of living is packed full of an overwhelming number of tasks and decisions.  As people increase
        the number of tasks they aspire to complete in a day, the amount of time it takes to organize, plan and make
        decisions also increases.  Most people don’t have the financial means to hire an assistant to help with this day
        to day administrative load.

        Productivity is valued highly  in today’s society.  Access to a free task assistant service is beneficial to
        anyone who is looking to increase their day to day productivity in an economical way.  The primary goal of a
        task assistant application is to save the user's time without increasing financial burden.  To fulfill this
        requirement, it is important that the service be simple to use. Users should only require internet access and
        a working email address to sign up and use the service. Signing up and creating lists should have minimal steps.
        Lists should be easily edited and reused.  Lists should have the ability to be shareable among users, to reduce
        time spent creating redundant lists. Lists should be well organized to allow users to quickly find what they are
        looking for. Since some items on a list are more important than others or need to be done more frequently, users
        must have the ability to set a priority for each item in order to simulate real life decision making.
